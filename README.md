# 🌿 Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio — a space where I showcase my work across **web development, UI/UX design, and art**.

## ✨ Update: Portfolio × Visual Journal Integration

I’ve decided to combine my **personal portfolio** and **visual journal** into a single, seamless experience — allowing visitors to explore my web projects, designs, and creative process all in one space.

This integration makes navigation smoother and storytelling more cohesive, reflecting how my **art, design, and development** intersect.

🎨 **New visuals:** Decorative elements (Leafs.png) were added to the _About_ and _Hero_ sections for a calm, polished aesthetic.
