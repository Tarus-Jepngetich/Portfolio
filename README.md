## ✨ Update: Portfolio × Visual Journal Integration

I’ve combined my **personal portfolio** and **visual journal** into a single, seamless experience — allowing visitors to explore my web projects, designs, and creative process all in one cohesive space.

This integration makes navigation smoother and storytelling more intentional, reflecting how my **art, design, and development** intersect in real life.

It represents the intersection of logic and art.
